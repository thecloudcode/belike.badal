# MySQL Joins and Normalization 🐬🔗

## Joins in MySQL 🌐

In MySQL, joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are several types of joins:

### Inner Join 🤝

An inner join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.Certainly! Here's a creative README.md file explaining joins and normalization in MySQL using emojis:

## Joins in MySQL 🌐

In MySQL, joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are several types of joins:

### Inner Join 🤝

An inner join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### Left Join 🌟

A left join returns all the rows from the left table (table1), along with matching rows from the right table (table2).

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### Right Join 🌠

A right join returns all the rows from the right table (table2), along with matching rows from the left table (table1).

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### Full Outer Join 🌈

A full outer join returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table. If there is no match, the result is NULL.

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

## Normalization in MySQL 📊

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. There are several normal forms (NF) to achieve this:

### First Normal Form (1NF) 📝

- Eliminate duplicate columns from the same table.
- Create separate tables for related data and identify unique columns.

### Second Normal Form (2NF) 📚

- Meet all the requirements of 1NF.
- Remove subsets of data that apply to multiple rows and place them in separate tables.
- Create relationships between these new tables and their predecessors through foreign keys.

### Third Normal Form (3NF) 📖

- Meet all the requirements of 2NF.
- Remove columns that are not dependent on the primary key.

### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) 🎓

- Meet all the requirements of 3NF.
- Every determinant must be a candidate key.

### Fourth Normal Form (4NF) 🌟

- Meet all the requirements of BCNF.
- A table should not have more than one multi-valued dependency.

### Fifth Normal Form (5NF) 🌌

- Meet all the requirements of 4NF.
- There should not be any join dependency.

Normalization helps in efficient database design, reducing redundant data and ensuring data integrity.
