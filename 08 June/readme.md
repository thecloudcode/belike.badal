## Inheritance in Python üêç

Inheritance is a powerful feature in Python that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. This promotes code reusability and can make complex code easier to manage.

### Basic Example

```python
# Parent class
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this method")

# Child class
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

# Usage
dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
```

### Key Points
- **Parent Class (Super Class)**: The class being inherited from.
- **Child Class (Sub Class)**: The class that inherits from the parent class.
- **`super()` Function**: Used to call a method from the parent class.

## Exception Handling in Python üö®

Exception handling is a mechanism in Python to handle runtime errors. It allows the program to continue execution or fail gracefully.

### Basic Example

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    # Code to handle the exception
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    # Code that will run no matter what
    print("This will run no matter what")
```

### Key Points
- **`try` Block**: Code that might throw an exception.
- **`except` Block**: Code that handles the exception.
- **`finally` Block**: Code that will run regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not.
- **Custom Exceptions**: You can create your own exception types by subclassing the `Exception` class.

## Creating a Flask API in Python üåê

Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. It is designed with simplicity and flexibility in mind.

### Basic Example

1. **Install Flask**: First, install Flask using pip.

    ```sh
    pip install flask
    ```

2. **Create a Simple API**:

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def home():
        return "Welcome to the Flask API!"

    @app.route('/data', methods=['GET'])
    def get_data():
        sample_data = {"key": "value", "number": 42}
        return jsonify(sample_data)

    @app.route('/data', methods=['POST'])
    def create_data():
        data = request.json
        return jsonify(data), 201

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```

3. **Running the Application**: Run your application using the command below and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser.

    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

### Key Points
- **Flask App**: An instance of the Flask class.
- **Routes**: Defined using the `@app.route` decorator to map URLs to functions.
- **HTTP Methods**: Common methods include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- **JSON Handling**: Use `request.json` to get JSON data sent to the endpoint and `jsonify` to return JSON responses.

## Conclusion üéâ

This README provides a brief overview of inheritance, exception handling, and creating a Flask API in Python. These fundamental concepts are essential for any Python developer. Happy coding! üöÄ
